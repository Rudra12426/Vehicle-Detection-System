# 🚗 Vehicle Detection System

## 📌 Overview
A real-time vehicle detection system built using YOLO and OpenCV. The system detects vehicles in video streams and draws bounding boxes around them.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time vehicle detection
- Bounding box visualization
- Supports webcam and video input
- YOLO-based object detection

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLO
- NumPy

## ▶ How to Run
pip install -r requirements.txt  
 vehicle_detection.ipynb

## 📽 Output
- Vehicles detected with bounding boxes
- Works on both video files and live camera
